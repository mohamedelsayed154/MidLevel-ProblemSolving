# 🚀 Algorithms & Problem Solving - Level 3  

This repo is my collection of solutions for **Course 7 : Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3** on [ProgrammingAdvices](https://www.programmingadvices.com/)  

I’m documenting my journey, not just the final code — but also the thought process and how I approached each problem  

## ✨ What you’ll find here
- Solutions written in **C++**  
- Focus on **ideas first**, then the code  
- Problems going from easy → tricky  
- Some experiments & drafts (not only the “perfect” solutions)  

## 🎯 Goal
Sharpen my problem solving skills, build a stronger foundation for competitive programming, and maybe help others learn along the way 👌
